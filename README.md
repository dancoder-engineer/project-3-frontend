# NeilCaff Message Board

NeilCaff is a simple message board system. Created by and for only the most power-hungry mods. Anyone can create an account and post, but only the mods can ban said users, and they can do so super quickly, and through an interface that shows due respect for the mods.

## Installation

In the backend folder:
Just type bundle install, and then rake server.

Then go to the frontend folder and type npm start.

## Contributing
You can make changes, but only if they increase and not decrease the power of the mods.
